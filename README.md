When submitting your assignment, include answers to the following.

# Identify the component of this assignment that you did the best on, and why.
I think I did my best on html. The CSS is ok, I think I still need some work on learning what all the attributes do. 

# Describe in plain english what problem this assignment was posing, and what your solution was to it.
The problem presented is to create a portfolio site where I talk about myself and showcase my work. 

# What was your approach or process?
My approach was to create the design on canva and try to copy it using HTML, CSS and javascript. 

# What were your challenges?
My biggest challenge was making my functions work. My function does not work, and I spent a ton of time, trying to make it look good but none of my ideas worked. I also had trouble with git, on both of my assingments this week, as it wouldn't push code to branch and kept giving errors. On this assignment I did a force push, but now I can't do a pull request because it saying the code is up to date. I am also submitting it late.

# What resources did you use?
w3schools, MDN and TA's.
